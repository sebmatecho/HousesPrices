# Housing Dynamics in King County (USA)
### Proposed by [SÃ©bastien Lozano-Forero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastienlozanoforero/)

## Project information
This project was proposed as way to showcase my skills, as part of my [Data Science Portfolio] (https://sebmatecho.github.io/Portfolio/). This end-to-end project starts with raw data (thanks Kaggle!) and ends with an app running in production able to describe housing dynamics and suggesting prices using a Machine Learning model.  
#### Methods used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning 
- Software Development
### Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Folium, Sckit-Learn, etc)
- Streamlit 
- Heroku

## Project Overview
This project aims to generate value out of one year of historical information of housing dynamics in King County (WA). This dataset is available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). The dataset contains information about number of rooms, bathrooms, location (latitude and longitude), number of floors, waterfront, view of water mark, construction assessment, footage and specially, price, among others.

Based on the provided information, we aim to add value to such data in two ways:
i. Developing a tool to better understand dynamics in the housing market of such region, and
ii. Propose a suitable and reasonable manner to suggest prices to given properties.
